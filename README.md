LAN : Local Area Network *already learned at Univ, but studying for reviewing
Topology : referring network's designs

star topology : each devices are indivisually connected via a central network device - switch, hub.
                any information sent to a device sent via central device.
                advantage : Scalable in nature - easy to add more devices.
                disadvantage : high costs, more maintenence required - harder troubleshooting
bus topology : all of connections are connected with a backbone cable, relies on it. backbone cable is branch, other devices are leaf.
                advantage : easier and most cost-efficient topologies to set up
                dis -- : easily bottlenecked so sometimes very difficult to troubleshooting
Ring topology : devices are connected directly to each other and form a loof -> little cabling required, less dependence
                works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device


Switch
Designed to aggregate(모으다) multiple other devices using network-capable devices using ethernet.
Switch based on MAC address - datalink layer, sends data packets in LAN. used in same network
Efficient, bacause it sends data without broadcasting
make network more efficient

Router 
based on IP address - Network layer. route a route, helping data go through another network
connect networks and pass data between them
router : 길잡이.

Hieriachically, Switch has lower position than Router.
Router manages network and outer-network, Switch manages communication into networks.
Router connected with WAN(광역네트워크), Switch connected with LAN
